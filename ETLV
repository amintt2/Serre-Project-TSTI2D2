The plus building:

The construction material used:
-	Low-carbon concrete
-	Recycled steel 
-	Solid wood and compressed wood
The energy produced:
-	The Plus will generate around 250,000 kWh of renewable energy per year, from more than 1,200 solar panels installed on the roof and in the area around the factory.
-	The Plus will have a supplied energy requirement of 13 kWh/m2 and therefore meets Future Built’s near-zero energy definition of 30 kWh/m2 by a substantial margin.
The insulation:
-	The Plus qualifies for the highest energy efficiency rating A.
-	The Plus will generate 55 per cent less greenhouse gas emissions than a conventional factory.

The enviromental inpact :
The building has been sited at the edge of the forest and the remaining area, around 95 percent of the site, is being preserved on nature's own premises.
The Plus aims to reduce the need for delivered energy by at least 90% compared to an equivalent factory building. With more than 2000 square metres of glass façades
